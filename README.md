# Wyaitt-Sketches


Welcome to the Wyaitt! 
This project generates images based on today's news.

## How it works

First, the project uses GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), an OpenAI language model, 
to select an article with today's news. GPT is able to generate natural language prompts based 
on a given article, which are then used as input for the Midjourney API.

Midjourney is an image generation API that uses machine learning algorithms to create 
sketches based on the text prompts.

## Results
